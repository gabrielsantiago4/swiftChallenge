| Welcome to SleepTracker! This program works as a sleeping hours calculator, in which you can track more closely the  |
| overall quality of your sleep weekly. It works in a very straightforward and simple way: for each day in the week,   |
| you must insert an approximate amount of the hours you slept in the previous night, as well as a grade, in a scale   |
| from 1 to 5, of how well you consider you're feeling after waking up.                                                |

    ü§¢ According to our evaluation, your sleep quality over this week can be considered very poor, and may be causing serious harm to your
       health. Your sleep schedule must be urgently changed. Medical literature strongly recommends that an adult should sleep at least 49
       hours per week, and disrespecting this minimum amount can lead to all kinds of health issues. Visit a doctor as soon as possible, and
